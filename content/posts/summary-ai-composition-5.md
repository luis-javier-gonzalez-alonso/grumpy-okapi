This guide dives into camera angles and movements to enrich AI‑generated images.  It categorises angles by vertical position, horizontal position, motion simulation and special stylised shots.  Below is a structured summary of the main ideas with prompt advice.  Citations link back to the original article.

## Vertical angles

### Eye‑level
Neutral and relatable: the camera is level with the subject’s eyes.  Use it for natural portraits or everyday scenes.  Prompts can simply state “eye‑level view” or rely on the model’s default.

### High angle & bird’s‑eye
Raising the camera above the subject makes the subject appear smaller or vulnerable.  A **high angle** looks down at a slight tilt; a **bird’s‑eye view** is even higher, emphasising patterns and layouts.  Prompts might say “high‑angle shot of a crowded market” or “bird’s‑eye view of the city streets” to get sweeping perspectives.

### Overhead/God’s‑eye
Directly overhead, looking straight down, ideal for highlighting symmetry and geometry (e.g., a spiral staircase).  Use “overhead shot” or “God’s‑eye view” to achieve this.

### Low angle & worm’s‑eye
Positioning the camera below the subject makes them appear dominant or heroic.  A low angle glances up; a worm’s‑eye view is extremely low, even at ground level.  Prompts like “low‑angle shot of a towering tree” convey awe.

## Horizontal angles

### Front view
The subject faces the camera directly, creating connection.  Simply state “front view portrait” when you want eye contact.

### Three‑quarter view
A 45‑degree angle reveals two sides of the subject, adding depth.  Use “three‑quarter view of the car” or “45‑degree angle” to avoid flatness.

### Profile & side view
A profile shows one side of the face; a side view captures the subject from 90 degrees.  This can feel detached or formal.  Prompts: “profile portrait with soft lighting”.

### Back view
Viewing the subject from behind creates mystery or contemplation.  Use “back view of a solitary figure gazing at the ocean”.

### Over‑the‑shoulder
An immersive shot where the camera peers over a character’s shoulder at another character or scene.  It establishes viewpoint and intimacy in narrative prompts.  E.g., “over‑the‑shoulder shot of a woman reading a letter, showing both the letter and the back of her head”.

## Motion & movement simulation

Simulated camera movements help convey action.  These techniques add cinematic energy to still images.

### Dolly‑in & dolly‑out
A **dolly‑in** (push‑in) moves toward the subject to heighten intensity; a **dolly‑out** pulls back to reveal context.  Prompts: “dolly‑in on the hero’s face, background blurring” or “dolly‑out from the tiny house to reveal a vast forest.”

### Tilt up & tilt down
Rotating the camera up or down shifts perspective: tilting up at a skyscraper emphasises height; tilting down reveals what’s below.

### Whip pan
A rapid horizontal pan causing motion blur, used to suggest speed or urgency.  Prompts might include “whip pan across city lights”.

### Tracking shot
The camera moves with the subject, keeping them sharp against a blurred background.  It’s great for action sequences: “tracking shot of a runner speeding down a dark street”.

### Crane shot & arc shot
A **crane shot** lifts or lowers the camera to reveal scale and context (e.g., rising from a field to reveal a castle).  An **arc shot** moves in a circle around the subject, adding energy and emphasising the subject’s centrality.

### Simulated drone shot
This implies movement across a landscape, as if filmed by a drone.  Describe the sweeping aerial motion in your prompt.

### Long‑take framing
Inspired by continuous shots in film, this technique layers multiple actions within one frame.  Prompts might place different story beats in foreground, mid‑ground and background.

## Specialty & stylised angles

These shots add mood or creative flair.

### Dutch angle
Tilting the camera diagonally creates unease or dynamism.  Use “Dutch‑angle shot of a chaotic street scene”.

### Point‑of‑view (POV) & over‑the‑weapon
POV shots place the viewer directly in a character’s position; over‑the‑weapon shots mimic first‑person shooter games.  Prompts: “POV of a knight drawing a sword”.

### Reflection shots
Capturing subjects through mirrors or reflective surfaces can add introspection or duality.  E.g., “reflection shot of a dancer in a dim studio”.

### Split diopter & silhouette
A split diopter keeps both foreground and background subjects in sharp focus, creating dual planes.  A silhouette emphasises shape and mood by backlighting the subject.

### X‑ray/magical vision
Seeing through objects or revealing inner layers adds a fantastical touch.  Prompts might describe “magical vision revealing the skeleton beneath a dragon’s scales”.

### Fisheye & distortion
Using an ultra‑wide lens causes barrel distortion and a playful or surreal look.  Describe “fisheye view of a skateboarder”.

## Combining angles

The article encourages mixing vertical, horizontal, motion and specialty descriptors to create complex prompts.  For instance, “low‑angle over‑the‑shoulder medium shot of a warrior drawing a bow” combines angle, framing size and perspective.  Remember that angles describe camera placement, while **perspective** (discussed in another article) relates to lens and depth.

## Quick‑reference summary

* **Vertical:** high angle, bird’s‑eye, overhead, low angle, worm’s‑eye, eye‑level.
* **Horizontal:** front, three‑quarter, profile, side, back, over‑the‑shoulder.
* **Framing sizes:** extreme close‑up, close‑up, medium, medium‑long, full, extreme wide.
* **Motion:** dolly in/out, tilt up/down, whip pan, tracking, crane, arc, drone, long take.
* **Specialty:** Dutch angle, POV, reflection, split diopter, silhouette, X‑ray/magical vision, fisheye.

Use these descriptors to craft prompts that not only place the subject but also evoke mood, story and motion.
