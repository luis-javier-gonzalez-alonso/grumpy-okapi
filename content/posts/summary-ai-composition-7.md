*Original article: [Simple Composition Tricks to Instantly Improve AI Images with Prompts: Color & Mood Edition](https://civitai.com/articles/18284/simple-composition-tricks-to-instantly-improve-ai-images-with-prompts-color-and-mood-edition)*

Colour profoundly influences the emotional impact of an image.  This guide outlines palettes, lighting effects and colour psychology to help you craft evocative AI prompts.  Below is a concise summary with tips and citations to the original text.

## Warm vs cool palettes

Warm colours (reds, oranges, yellows) evoke energy, passion and warmth, while cool colours (blues, greens, purples) suggest calmness and introspection.  Choose a dominant palette based on the desired mood: a warm palette for sunset romance or a cool palette for serene underwater scenes.

### Prompt tips

* Use phrases like “warm golden hues” or “cool sapphire tones.”
* Combine with time‑of‑day cues (sunrise → warm; twilight → cool).

## Contrast & intensity

High contrast (intense colour differences) creates drama and visual interest; low contrast with muted colours feels gentle or nostalgic.  Specify whether you want *vivid, high‑contrast lighting* or *soft pastel tones*.

## Dramatic lighting & colour grading

Lighting choices interact with colour.  Dramatic, directional light emphasises shadows and highlights; cinematic colour grading can shift overall hues.  Prompts could call for “neon glow casting magenta and cyan light” or “sepia‑toned photograph with warm brown highlights.”

## Monochrome & limited palettes

Restricting the colour range focuses attention on form and mood.  A monochrome prompt might read “monochromatic blue landscape” or “duotone purple and teal street scene.”  Limited palettes work well with minimalist compositions.

## Colour psychology & symbolism

The article lists common associations: **red** for passion and danger, **blue** for calm and melancholy, **green** for nature and growth, **yellow** for joy, **purple** for mystery or royalty, **black** for elegance or mourning, and **white** for purity or emptiness.  Use these associations to reinforce your narrative.

## Atmospheric & mood lighting

Different lighting conditions convey distinct moods.  The article highlights:

* **Golden hour:** warm, soft light near sunrise or sunset.
* **Blue hour:** cool light just before sunrise or after sunset.
* **Neon glow:** bright, saturated colours typical of city nightlife.
* **Foggy haze:** diffused light and reduced contrast, evoking mystery.
* **Silhouette:** backlighting creates high contrast shapes.
* **Cinematic grading:** stylised colour shifts reminiscent of film.

### Prompt examples

* “Portrait bathed in golden hour light with warm orange highlights.”
* “Moody alleyway illuminated by neon pink and blue lights.”
* “Forest shrouded in fog, colours muted and desaturated.”

## Combining colour techniques

Mix warm and cool colours for complex moods; pair monochrome palettes with dramatic lighting; or layer atmospheric effects over a limited palette.  For example, “a cool blue palette with warm candlelight flickering on stone walls” merges warm/cool contrast with specific light sources.

## Differences between colour/mood and composition

Colour affects emotional tone, whereas composition determines spatial arrangement.  Use colour deliberately to complement the compositional techniques described in other guides.

## Quick‑reference summary

* **Warm palette:** reds, oranges, yellows (energy, passion).  **Cool palette:** blues, greens, purples (calm, introspection).
* **High contrast:** vivid colours; **low contrast:** muted pastels.
* **Monochrome / limited palettes:** focus on form and mood.
* **Colour symbolism:** red → passion/danger; blue → calm; green → nature; yellow → joy; purple → mystery; black → elegance/mourning; white → purity.
* **Atmospheric/mood lighting:** golden hour, blue hour, neon glow, fog/haze, silhouette, cinematic grading.
