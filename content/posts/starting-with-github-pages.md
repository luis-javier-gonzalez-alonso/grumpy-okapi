There are plenty of resources online to get a good idea of how to set GH Pages up.

In short:
- Accessing Project > Settings > Pages, we need to select the branch holding the site
- There is a limitation on the folders to serve from this branch. We can select either '/' or '/docs'
- Once enabled, it will create the needed actions, and when a change happens in the selected branch, this action will update the site on GitHub servers
- Uses Jekyll by default, but we can easily disable the processing by adding a '.nojekill' file
- The default themes are a bit limited, but there are plenty of Themes online to customize your site
