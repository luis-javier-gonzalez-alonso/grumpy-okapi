This companion guide builds upon the basics by introducing additional composition techniques and explaining when to use them. Each concept shows how simple wording can nudge AI models toward desired layouts.

## Additional composition techniques

| Technique | Idea & prompting tips |
|---|---|
| **Centered composition** | Placing the subject in the exact center gives symmetry and formality. Although AI models often default to centering, explicitly asking for “centered composition” or “subject centered” helps avoid accidental asymmetry. Centering works well for portraits, graphic posters and scenes requiring stability. |
| **Minimalism** | Less is more: include very few elements and lots of empty space. Prompts such as “minimalist composition,” “simple background” or “no clutter” encourage the model to leave negative space. Minimalism emphasises shape, colour and mood. |
| **Diagonal composition** | Arrange leading elements on a diagonal or tilt the camera slightly. Words like “diagonal composition,” “tilted camera” or describing a road running from bottom‑left to top‑right produce a dynamic, energetic feel. |
| **Repetition & patterns** | Use rows or repeating motifs (e.g., columns, umbrellas, soldiers). Prompt with “repeating pattern of…,” “rows of…,” or similar. Including a break in the pattern (one element different from the rest) can add focal interest. |
| **Negative vs. positive space** | Balance an off‑center subject with empty space on the opposite side. Phrases such as “lots of empty space on the left” or “subject on right third, empty space on left” encourage this balance. |
| **Radial composition** | Arrange elements radiating from a central point (like spokes on a wheel or petals of a flower). Use “radiating from the center” or “circular pattern” to evoke mandalas and radial symmetry. |
| **Triangular composition** | Place three major elements forming a triangle. Prompts like “arranged as a triangle” or “triangle formation” help create stable groupings. |
| **Asymmetrical balance with negative space** | Balance a single subject on one side with open space on the opposite. Use words such as “subject on right third, empty space on left” to stress emptiness and avoid clutter. |

## Practical guidance

- **Combine techniques**: A centered subject can still be framed by radial patterns or placed in negative space. Experiment with layering two or more techniques for unique effects.
- **Repeat emptiness cues**: Many models like to fill the frame; repeating cues such as “empty,” “blank,” or “minimalist” can discourage unwanted details.
- **Patterns and variation**: When requesting repeating elements, specify numbers and placements (“four columns evenly spaced,” “row of soldiers in identical uniforms except for one holding a flag”) to help the model understand repetition and the intended break.
- **Symmetry vs. asymmetry**: Use symmetry to convey formality and balance; use asymmetry with empty space to create tension or focus.

These additional tricks offer more options for structuring AI‑generated scenes. Understanding how to use empty space, repetition, diagonals and geometric arrangements helps create images that feel intentional and refined.
