Lighting shapes mood and depth.  This guide details various lighting styles, directionality, shadow effects and atmospheric light.  Below is a concise summary with prompt pointers.  Citations refer back to the original text.

## Dramatic lighting styles

* **Chiaroscuro:** strong contrast between light and dark, often with a single light source.  Use “chiaroscuro portrait with half the face in shadow.”
* **Rembrandt lighting:** a small triangular patch of light on the shadowed cheek, adding depth and sophistication.
* **Low‑key lighting:** predominantly dark with selective highlights for moody, mysterious scenes.
* **High‑key lighting:** bright and evenly lit, conveying optimism or cleanliness.
* **Theatrical lighting:** coloured spotlights or dramatic stage lighting for fantasy or performance scenes.

## Directional light & glow

* **Rim lighting:** light hits the edges of the subject, creating an outline.
* **Backlighting:** light behind the subject creates silhouettes and haloes.
* **Halo/halo glow:** radiant glow surrounding an object for ethereal or divine effects.
* **Spotlight & stage lighting:** focused beams isolate subjects, often with visible light cones.

## Soft vs hard light

* **Soft, diffused light** (overcast sky, window light) creates gentle shadows and a flattering look.
* **Hard light** (direct noon sun, harsh spotlight) produces sharp shadows and strong texture.

## Atmospheric & environmental light

The article highlights various light sources and conditions:

* **Golden hour:** warm, low‑angle sunlight with long shadows.
* **Blue hour:** cool, twilight light.
* **Moonlight:** soft blue‑grey illumination.
* **Candlelight & firelight:** warm, flickering glow.
* **Neon glow:** saturated colours typical of city nightlife.
* **Cinematic lighting & colour grading:** stylised lighting combined with colour shifts.

## Shadow techniques & effects

* **Cast shadows:** shadows falling on surfaces help ground objects.
* **Long shadows:** low‑angle light stretches shadows, adding drama.
* **Silhouettes:** subjects backlit to appear as dark shapes against a bright background.
* **Dappled/patterned shadows:** light filtering through leaves or lattice creates patterns.
* **Overlapping shadows:** multiple light sources produce layered shadows.
* **Shadow storytelling:** shadows hint at unseen elements (e.g., a child casting a monster shadow).
* **Abstract shadow play:** creative manipulation of shadows for surreal compositions.

## Combining light and shadow techniques

Mixing different lights and shadows creates complex moods.  For instance, rim lighting plus dappled shadows can highlight texture while maintaining dramatic contrast.  Layering coloured light (neon) with silhouettes can evoke cyberpunk vibes.  The article encourages experimentation.

## Difference between light & shadow vs colour & mood

Light and shadow define the structure and focus of a scene, whereas colour and mood influence emotional tone.  Use lighting strategies to sculpt forms and direct attention, then apply colour palettes for emotional resonance.

## Quick‑reference summary
