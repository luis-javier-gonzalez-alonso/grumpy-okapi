Texture adds tactile richness to images and can communicate story and symbolism.  This guide categorises textures, material qualities and detail levels.  The following summary presents key concepts with prompting advice.  Citations refer back to the original guide.

## Surface contrast

Opposing textures create visual interest.  Examples include **rough vs smooth**, **cracked vs polished**, or **weathered vs pristine** surfaces.  Prompts could describe “weathered wood against sleek metal” or “cracked clay pots beside polished stone.”

## Material qualities

* **Glossy vs matte:** Glossy surfaces reflect light; matte surfaces diffuse it.  Mention this in prompts: “glossy ceramic bowl on a matte linen tablecloth.”
* **Reflective vs dull:** Mirrors, chrome and still water reflect; aged metal or stone absorbs light.

## Softness & sharpness

Contrast soft textures (silky fabrics, moss) with sharp or jagged textures (thorns, broken glass).  Prompts might include “feather‑soft petals contrasted with jagged metal shards.”

## Natural textures

The article lists natural materials: bark, moss, fur, feathers, stone, sand, snow, water.  Use these to evoke wilderness or seasons.  For instance, “frosted snow crystals glistening on rough bark.”

## Artificial textures

Artificial materials include metal, glass, leather, plastic, textiles, paper and concrete.  Prompts can combine them: “crinkled paper lanterns hanging above smooth concrete walls.”

## Micro vs macro detail

Fine details like tiny water droplets or intricate lace differ from bold, coarse textures like cracked paint.  Decide whether you want **micro‑detail** or **macro‑detail** and state it: “close‑up of intricate frost patterns on a window” versus “bold, cracked earth texture.”

## Patterned surfaces

Textures often form patterns—woven fabrics, tiles, scales or fractals.  Specify the pattern type (“honeycomb tiles,” “repeating scale pattern”) and note any variation or irregularity.

## Light & texture interaction

Lighting emphasises texture: strong side lighting reveals bumps and grooves; backlighting creates glistening edges; diffused light softens surfaces.  Mention the light direction and quality when you want to highlight texture.

## Tactile symbolism

Textures carry associations.  The article notes: **marble** suggests timeless elegance; **rust** evokes decay; **glass** implies fragility.  Use these connotations to reinforce narrative (“rusty tools hint at abandonment”).

## Combining textures for storytelling

Juxtaposing textures can suggest contrasts in character or environment—like delicate lace draped over rough stone—while consistent textures create cohesion.  Mix natural and artificial materials to highlight human versus nature themes.

## Differences between texture/detail and light & shadow

Textures and details describe surface qualities, whereas light and shadow define how these surfaces are perceived.  Use texture descriptions to set the tactile mood, then apply lighting strategies to reveal or obscure them.

## Quick‑reference summary

* **Rough, smooth, cracked, polished, weathered, pristine**.
* **Glossy, matte, reflective, dull**.
* **Soft, sharp, gritty, silky, mossy, rusty, scaly**.
* **Woven, tiled/mosaic, grainy, porous, intricate, bold texture**.
* **Glistening, frosted, peeling, embossed, patina, fibrous, lacy**.

Use these descriptors to bring tactile richness and symbolic meaning to your AI image prompts.
