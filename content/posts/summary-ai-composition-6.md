*Original article: [Simple Composition Tricks to Instantly Improve AI Images with Prompts: Perspective Edition](https://civitai.com/articles/18244/simple-composition-tricks-to-instantly-improve-ai-images-with-prompts-perspective-edition)*

Perspective governs how depth and spatial relationships are rendered.  This article explains different perspective types and how to prompt them.  Below is a breakdown of each perspective with practical advice and references back to the original text.

## One‑point perspective

Lines converge toward a single vanishing point on the horizon, creating a strong sense of depth and direction.  It’s often used for head‑on views like roads, hallways or piers.  Prompts might say “long pier stretching to the sea, one‑point perspective” or “railway tracks converging at the horizon.”  A *central vanishing point*—when the point sits in the centre—produces formal, symmetrical compositions reminiscent of grand halls.

### Tips

* Use words like *leading lines*, *central vanishing point*, or *straight on*.
* Place a subject at the end of the path to draw the eye.
* Great for tunnels, bridges, boulevards or corridors.

## Two‑point perspective

This perspective uses two vanishing points on the horizon, ideal for showing corners of buildings or streets.  It reveals two faces of an object, adding dynamism.  Prompts: “quaint café on a street corner in two‑point perspective” or “sketch of a house at an angle.”  It’s excellent for urban scenes and interiors.

### Prompt pointers

* Specify the building or object and mention *two vanishing points*.
* Describe the angle (45 degrees) to hint at the corner view.
* Works well with architectural styles where edges are important.

## Three‑point perspective

Adding a third vanishing point above or below creates dramatic scale—perfect for looking up at skyscrapers or down from cliffs.  Use this to emphasise height or depth.  Prompts might include “view from atop a cliff looking down at a village, three‑point perspective” or “towering skyscraper seen from ground level.”

### Practical tips

* Mention the vertical vanishing point (above or below) to guide the model.
* Combine with low‑angle or high‑angle descriptors from the camera‑angles guide.
* Good for extreme height differences or dramatic architecture.

## Isometric perspective

In an **isometric** view there are no vanishing points; lines remain parallel, producing a pseudo‑3D effect reminiscent of maps and game art.  It’s useful for architectural diagrams, city layouts or cutaway scenes.  Prompts could say “isometric view of a cyberpunk city” or “isometric cross‑section of a bustling marketplace.”

### Tips

* Use the keyword *isometric* to ensure parallel lines.
* Great for top‑down storytelling or stylised scenes.
* Combine with vibrant colours to evoke game‑like aesthetics.

## Atmospheric & depth perspectives

### Aerial/atmospheric perspective
Objects become lighter, bluer and hazier with distance because of atmospheric scattering.  Prompting for “misty mountains fading into blue haze” or “distant buildings shrouded in fog” conveys depth.  Gradual colour shifts from warm/saturated foreground to cool/desaturated background enhance realism.

### Gradient fading
Smoothly transitioning tones and colours can create a sense of depth even without a clear vanishing point.  Prompts might describe a field of flowers where colours fade as they recede.

### Scale & depth tricks
Using relative size and overlapping objects (large foreground elements, progressively smaller background elements) suggests depth.  Combine with atmospheric haze for maximum effect.

## Forced & exaggerated perspectives

### Forced perspective
Also covered in the emotional & narrative guide, this technique positions objects to create optical tricks (e.g., a person holding a distant sun).  Include phrases like “forced perspective” and specify the foreground and background elements.

### Extreme wide‑angle & fisheye
Using ultra‑wide or fisheye lenses exaggerates depth and curvature.  Prompts may state “extreme wide‑angle view of a cathedral interior” or “fisheye shot of a skateboarder”.  These perspectives can feel dynamic or surreal.

## Summary of perspective keywords

* **One‑point:** single vanishing point, tunnels, corridors, head‑on roads.
* **Two‑point:** corners of buildings, angled views, two faces visible.
* **Three‑point:** looking up/down at tall structures or cliffs.
* **Isometric:** parallel lines, map‑like diagrams, game art.
* **Atmospheric:** hazy, misty distances, gradient fading.
* **Forced perspective:** optical tricks using size and alignment.
* **Extreme wide‑angle / fisheye:** exaggerated depth and barrel distortion.

Understanding these perspectives allows you to guide how the AI interprets space and depth, complementing the camera‑angle techniques discussed in the related guide.
