*Original article: [Simple Composition Tricks to Instantly Improve AI Images with Prompts](https://civitai.com/articles/16602/simple-composition-tricks-to-instantly-improve-ai-images-with-prompts)*

This first instalment introduces ten classic composition techniques borrowed from photography and art that can be invoked with prompt language. Each technique includes a definition, when to use it and how to phrase prompts so AI models understand the concept.

## Key composition tricks

| Technique | Idea & prompting tips |
|---|---|
| **Rule of thirds** | Divide the frame into a 3×3 grid and place important elements along the lines or at the intersections to create interest. Use phrases like “rule of thirds composition,” “subject on the right third,” or “position the tree at the lower‑left intersection”. |
| **Leading lines** | Use roads, rivers or architectural lines that guide the viewer’s eyes toward the subject. Describe the line and its direction: e.g., “a winding path leads toward the tree”. |
| **Symmetry vs. asymmetry** | Balanced mirrored scenes feel formal; asymmetrical placement with empty space feels dynamic. To prompt symmetry, say “symmetrical composition” or “perfect reflection”; for asymmetry, mention “subject off‑center, negative space on the left”. |
| **Negative space** | Large empty areas around the subject create a minimalist, serene mood. Include terms like “negative space,” “vast empty sky” or “open field,” and avoid adding clutter. |
| **Depth & layering** | Divide the scene into foreground, middle and background to give depth. Prompts can explicitly list layers (e.g., “flowers in foreground, cottage in middle, mountains in background”). |
| **Dutch angle (tilted horizon)** | Tilting the camera creates tension or dynamism. Use words such as “Dutch angle,” “tilted camera” or “canted shot”. |
| **Framing within the frame** | Use natural frames such as windows, arches or tree branches to surround the subject. Describe the framing element (“an arch frames the courtyard,” “seen through a keyhole”). |
| **Bokeh & depth of field** | Emphasize the subject by keeping it in sharp focus while the background is blurred. Phrases like “shallow depth of field,” “bokeh background,” and specifying an f‑stop encourage this effect. |
| **Golden ratio / spiral** | Arrange elements along a spiralling curve inspired by the golden ratio. Prompt with “golden ratio composition,” “spiral leading to the subject,” or describe a swirl of elements. |
| **High & low camera angles** | High‑angle shots look down and make subjects seem small or vulnerable; low‑angle shots look up and make subjects appear powerful. Use “high‑angle,” “bird’s‑eye view,” “low‑angle” or “worm’s‑eye view”. |

## Practical guidance

- **Combine techniques**: Many prompts work best when techniques are combined. A rule‑of‑thirds composition with leading lines and a shallow depth of field can feel very cinematic.
- **Use position words**: Phrases like *foreground*, *background*, *left third*, and *center* help the model position elements correctly.
- **Explicit keywords**: Because AI models may ignore subtle composition cues, include explicit words (“Dutch angle,” “negative space”) to improve compliance.
- **Experiment and iterate**: Results may vary across models. Adjust the wording, add or remove detail, and observe how the model responds.

This article sets the foundation for composition techniques used throughout the series. Understanding how to describe spatial relationships gives prompts structure and improves the professionalism of AI‑generated images.
